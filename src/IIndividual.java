/**
 * The IIndividual interface provides methods getFitness, calculateFitness, clone, permutation,

 * The getFitness method should return the fitness value of the implementing type.
 * The calculateFitness method should calculate and set the fitness value of the implementing type.
 * The clone method returns a new instance of the implementing type and initializes all its fields
 * with exactly the same contents of the corresponding fields.
 * The permutation method returns a new instance of the implementing type where its representation has been permuted.
 * The twoBitSwapMutation returns a new instance of the implementing type where two bits of its representation were swapped, according to a given probability.
 * The crossOver method returns a List of new instances of the implementing type, which represent the offspring, according to a given probability.
 * The ILocation interface also provides a method for the implementer to specify its String representation.
